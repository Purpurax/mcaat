## ðŸ§¬ MCAAT - Metagenomic CRISPR Array Analysis Tool

- CRISPR-Cas is a bacterial immune system also famous for its use in genome editing. The diversity of known systems could be significantly increased by metagenomic data. 
- Here we present the Metagenomic CRISPR Array Analysis Tool MCAAT, a highly sensitive algorithm for finding CRISPR Arrays in un-assembled metagenomic data. 
- It takes advantage of the properties of CRISPR arrays that form multicycles in de Bruijn graphs. 
- MCAAT's assembly-free graph-based strategy outperforms assembly-based workflows and other assembly-free methods on synthetic and real metagenomes.

## Installation using docker
### Docker Build

```bash
docker build -t mcaat .
```

---

### Run the Tool Using Docker

Mount your working directory to access input/output files:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/data mcaat \
  --input_files /data/reads_R1.fastq /data/reads_R2.fastq \
  --output-folder /data/results
```

---

### Final Image Size

The final image is based on `debian:bookworm-slim` and includes only:

- The `mcaat` binary
- Runtime libraries: `libomp5`, `zlib1g`

This keeps the image small and portable.

---

### Clean Up

To remove the image:

```bash
docker rmi mcaat
```

## Compiling the project

### ðŸ”§ Build the Project
To allow ./install.sh make changes, we execute following command:
```bash
chmod +x ./install.sh
```
You can build the project and the working version will be saved in the build folder.
```bash
./install.sh
```
It is also possible to install the library by simply putting the --install flag.
```bash
./install.sh --install
```
---


## Usage

```bash
./mcaat --input-files <file1> [file2] [--ram <amount>] [--threads <num>] [--output-folder <path>] [--help]
```

---

- Required Arguments

  - `--input-files <file1> [file2]`  
    One or two input FASTA/FASTQ files.  
    - If one file is provided, it is treated as single-end data.  
    - If two files are provided, they are treated as paired-end reads.

- Optional Arguments

  - `--ram <amount>`  
    Maximum RAM to use. Supports units:  
    - `B` (bytes), `K` (kilobytes), `M` (megabytes), `G` (gigabytes)  
    - **Default:** 95% of system RAM  
    - **Example:** `--ram 4G`

  - `--threads <num>`  
    Number of threads to use.  
    - **Default:** total CPU cores minus 2

  - `--output-folder <path>`  
    Output directory for results.  
    - If not provided, a timestamped folder will be created automatically.  
    - If provided, the folder is used exactly as given (no timestamp added).

  - `--help`, `-h`  
    Show usage information and exit.

---

- Output Structure

  The tool creates the following directory structure inside the specified output folder:

  ```
  <output-folder>/
  â”œâ”€â”€ CRISPR_Arrays.txt
  ```

- Example

    ```bash
    ./mcaat \
      --input_files reads_R1.fastq reads_R2.fastq \
      --ram 8G \
      --threads 12 \
      --output-folder results/my_run
    ```

This will create a folder like `results/my_run/` with all outputs inside.

  - If `--output-folder` is omitted:

    ```bash
    ./mcaat --input_files reads.fastq
    ```

    Then a folder like `mcaat_run_2025-07-07_15-30-00/` will be created automatically.

---

## Notes

- Input files must exist and be accessible.
- If RAM is set below 1 GB or above system capacity, the program will exit with an error.
- If only one input file is provided, the tool assumes single-end data.

---

## Requirements

- C++17 compiler
- [RapidFuzz](https://github.com/maxbachmann/rapidfuzz-cpp) (for fuzzy string matching)
- Filesystem support (`<filesystem>`)
