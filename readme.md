## üß¨ MCAAT - Metagenomic CRISPR Array Analysis Tool

- CRISPR-Cas is a bacterial immune system also famous for its use in genome editing. The diversity of known systems could be significantly increased by metagenomic data. 
- Here we present the Metagenomic CRISPR Array Analysis Tool MCAAT, a highly sensitive algorithm for finding CRISPR Arrays in un-assembled metagenomic data. 
- It takes advantage of the properties of CRISPR arrays that form multicycles in de Bruijn graphs. 
- MCAAT's assembly-free graph-based strategy outperforms assembly-based workflows and other assembly-free methods on synthetic and real metagenomes.

## Installation using docker
### Docker Build

```bash
docker build -t mcaat .
```

---

### Run the Tool Using Docker

Mount your working directory to access input/output files:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/data mcaat \
  --input_files /data/reads_R1.fastq /data/reads_R2.fastq \
  --output-folder /data/results
```

---

### Final Image Size

The final image is based on `debian:bookworm-slim` and includes only:

- The `mcaat` binary
- Runtime libraries: `libomp5`, `zlib1g`

This keeps the image small and portable.

---

### Clean Up

To remove the image:

```bash
docker rmi mcaat
```

## Compiling the project
### üì¶ System Requirements

- Linux (Ubuntu/Debian recommended)
- C++17-compatible compiler (e.g. `g++` ‚â• 7 or `clang++`)
- CMake ‚â• 3.12
- Git

---

### üìö Required Dependencies

Install the following packages using `apt`:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
  build-essential \
  cmake \
  git \
  zlib1g-dev \
  libomp-dev \
  libpthread-stubs0-dev
```

---

### üì• Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/yourusername/mcaat.git
cd mcaat
```

> If you forgot `--recurse-submodules`, run:
>
> ```bash
> git submodule update --init --recursive
> ```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Build the Project

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

This will generate the `mcaat` binary in the `build/` directory.

---

### üöÄ Run the Tool

```bash
./mcaat --input_files <file1> [file2] [--ram <amount>] [--threads <num>] [--output-folder <path>]
```

Use `--help` to see all available options:

```bash
./mcaat --help
```

---


## Usage

```bash
./mcaat --input-files <file1> [file2] [--ram <amount>] [--threads <num>] [--output-folder <path>] [--help]
```

---

### Required Arguments

- `--input-files <file1> [file2]`  
  One or two input FASTA/FASTQ files.  
  - If one file is provided, it is treated as single-end data.  
  - If two files are provided, they are treated as paired-end reads.

---

### Optional Arguments

- `--ram <amount>`  
  Maximum RAM to use. Supports units:  
  - `B` (bytes), `K` (kilobytes), `M` (megabytes), `G` (gigabytes)  
  - **Default:** 95% of system RAM  
  - **Example:** `--ram 4G`

- `--threads <num>`  
  Number of threads to use.  
  - **Default:** total CPU cores minus 2

- `--output-folder <path>`  
  Output directory for results.  
  - If not provided, a timestamped folder will be created automatically.  
  - If provided, the folder is used exactly as given (no timestamp added).

- `--help`, `-h`  
  Show usage information and exit.

---

### Output Structure

The tool creates the following directory structure inside the specified output folder:

```
<output-folder>/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CRISPR_Arrays.txt         # Raw CRISPR array output
```

---

### Example

```bash
./mcaat \
  --input_files reads_R1.fastq reads_R2.fastq \
  --ram 8G \
  --threads 12 \
  --output-folder results/my_run
```

This will create a folder like `results/my_run/` with all outputs inside.

If `--output-folder` is omitted:

```bash
./mcaat --input_files reads.fastq
```

Then a folder like `mcaat_run_2025-07-07_15-30-00/` will be created automatically.

---

## Notes

- Input files must exist and be accessible.
- If RAM is set below 1 GB or above system capacity, the program will exit with an error.
- If only one input file is provided, the tool assumes single-end data.

---

## Requirements

- C++17 compiler
- [RapidFuzz](https://github.com/maxbachmann/rapidfuzz-cpp) (for fuzzy string matching)
- Filesystem support (`<filesystem>`)
